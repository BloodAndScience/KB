# Meditation

Okay I know 100 of reseraches and tried it many times

## ADHD 

- You don't have to stop moving
- Control `monkey mind`


## Adrinaline life

- Doing something at last minute
- To many to-do's .
- Grant plans we never work on.

It's all just sympthoms to stimulate the brain.

## Meditation Roadmap
1. **Repeat** *thousand times*:
 “Meditation is a practice. I intend to enjoy and learn from the experience. There are no wrong ways to do it.”
2. *Medicate* before Meditation
