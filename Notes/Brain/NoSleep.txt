NO SLEEP:

So time to time depending on the weather and banch of other factors. 
Like not sleeping enough. I can be extremly sleepy and that will stop me from working. 
So I am looking for recepie

1. Meditate( It help to relax)  - Stress and sleepenes somehow connected.
2. Mini workout.
3. Get short nap. 


18:40 experiment

I will try to take short 30 minutes nap.
Myabe it will work maybe not will see. 

Get excited about something.
Try to reduce amount of light you have. 

So if you feel sleepy and you need to work 
accepting that you need sleep and getting to more comfortable pose.
Can actually make you less sleepy. Like sort of it makes you happy.
And happy you are more productive you. 
That simple get posture for sleep. 
Alow your self to relax remove pressure and you will become productive.

Remove presure and you will become productive again.
