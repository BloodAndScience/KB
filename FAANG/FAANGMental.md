Today on the call with Kyle I notice how calm he is about bad newses and how little they actually effect him. 

I **MUST** build such mentalitie. I believe one of the key concepts might be:

- Box brathing
- Mediation
- **DONT PANIC**
- Running/Workout(back pain)
- Daily rutine.
- Not allowing myself to freak out

There was mutiple times that I could have good life. But I wasn't able to focus on daily tasks. Because was owerwhelmed on daily tasks. Than I had a big technical debt and wasn't able to deliever anthing at all.
