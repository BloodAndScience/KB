- The Process of building Character
  - Today you create character that will support you 
    in 5 year, 10 year or 20 years.
  - Or today you make character that will make you loser
    and make you stay that way in 5 year, 10 year, 20 year.

- The moment you actually forge your character is moment:
   - When you overcome difficulties.
   - When you working on you're goal long after the mood of setting it left you.
   - When you *lookin* to resources you need to achive it(money,time,will power, trainigs)
   - When you overcome lack of time, lack of money, lack of organization, lack of knowledge
   - When you say **NO** you friend on his request *"Go DO SOME FUN"*
