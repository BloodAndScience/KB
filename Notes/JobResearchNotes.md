### 0-1

* Faking / extending work experience might be necessary to get a desirable job, just being good at it is not always
  enough.
* Having some commercial experience is really important (of which I have none).

### IT-Market

* O-1 Visa can be acquired through active engagement in the chosen field - winning competitions, being a judge in one
  etc. One can register their own company and import themselves into the US to look for a job later.
* One has much more possibilities in job hunting while being on American soil.
  <p> One can practice interviews while still being in their respective home country and lying about being there
  on <br>
  holidays with the family.</p>


* Things that are **important** for the potential employer:
    * Having a US phone number, get a fake one.
    * Visa and legal status.
    * Already working in California would be a of great benefit.
* Having a person an insider interested in getting you in would streamline the process, duh!.
* First apply for mediocre places to gain experience of going through interviews, solving test problems etc (even if you
  don't really want to work there you should do it for the experience).
* Knowledge of programming algorithms is of utmost importance. One should study them before an important tech interview.
* One looking for a senior position is expected to know functioning of and being able to design complete systems -
  frontend / backend, data
  caching, performance optimization etc.
* Lead Tech positions sometimes require multiple interviews on Systems Design.
* To prepare one can use examples on YouTube, pair interviews etc.
* During an interview one should say out-loud stuff they're typing and describe their train of thought.
* One should also carefully listen to the interviewer - they can lightly push you in the right direction.

### Soft Skills

* One should not argue wit the interviewer. Acknowledge your mistakes and be positive. You're nor a
  machine for writing
  code but a potential member of the team, social skills are a must.
* If you have to implement non optimal solution acknowledge that you understand it is not the best but you're suing it
  for the sake of saving time, It will let the interviewer know that you're aware of the more optimal solution.
* Prepare to answer questions about past workplace conflicts and the way you acted during them, taking initiative,
  making mistakes or doing tasks no-one asked for. These questions are targeted towards evaluation of the possibility of
  assimilation into the existing work culture and environment of the workplace they have in place.
* Research STAR (Situation — Target — Action — Result) technique. Practice answering questions in front of a mirror.
  In layman's terms structure your answers in sequencers of Situation, your Goal, the Thing you did to achieve it and
  the end Result you got.
* Don't forget to explain what you've learned from those experiences. It always has to be positive even if the
  experience you're talking about was negative.
* Describe the worst situations you've experienced at the workplace and explain how much you've learned and made you a
  better person in the end, emphasise learning from own mistakes and not repeating them.
* Be mentally prepared for rejection.

### How to get details about interviewing process in specific companies

* Interview process:
  2-3 min icebreaker. Prepare short and informative introduction for yourself. After that you talk algorithms for the
  duration of the interview. Sometimes you can have 5 minutes in the end to ask the Interviewer your own questions. It's
  important you get those 5 minutes.
* On the other hand in some companies interviewing process is setup differently, and you should prepare for them
  specifically.
* Research those on the web, check for company's leadership's statements, key employees suggestions etc.

### Interviewing styles of different companies

* Out of FAANG Amazon is the shittiest with culture trying to squeeze out of the employees every ounce of productivity,
  bad management, constant overtime etc.
* Some companies outside of FAANG may employ different tactics - for example instead of testing the abstract knowledge
  of algorithms they may test your skills in specific technologies for example React. It can be an onsite interview with
  multiple participants who's tasks extend each other's work. First participant can be asked to sketch something out in
  JS or React. The next one would be tasked with building something on top of it. By the end of fifth interview you may
  have a meaningful project, something to be proud of.
* Twitter sends out a pretty basic test task with a time limit say up to 3 hours. Then based on the test they conduct
  the interview - ask about the decisions you've made, what could be done better,
  what would you do if you needed to extend the system etc.
* Facebook tests solid technical skills.

### Specific research on companies

* Check anonymous feedback on the web. Expect it to be mostly negative but it can give you some idea about the company.
* Use the final minutes of the interview to double check that feedback. Ask about the work environment, amount of
  overtime, the way they solve conflict situations. Sometimes people would lie to you but you can still draw your
  conclusions from the way they answer those questions or outright avoid them. You may ask "What would you like to
  improve in your work environment?" instead of asking about negative sides of the job ask instead what would they like
  to see improved.

### Offers stage

* Treat job hunting as a full time job of it's own. Finding a good place can take up to a few months. O-1 visa can be
  problematic for some companies and may take a long time to process. Thoroughly
  research [Total compensation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/120616/difference-between-annual-compensation-and-annual-salary.asp)
  for specific companies, [Shares offered](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eso.asp) etc.
* In the US employers value experience working specifically in US companies. A single US company in Linkedin is enough
  to get some recruiters to contact you.
* When a test task would take more than 2 hours consider looking for an alternative.
* When considering an offer take into account [Cost of living](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator)
  in the area where the company is located.

### Bargaining and being a Jew

* If you already have some offers use them to negotiate for better salary in other companies.
* If a company gives you an offer, but a short time to make a decision do your best to extend it - they don't want you
  to use the offer to negotiate with other potential employers.
* Do your best to avoid concrete answers to salary expectation question.
* You can do it if you want it.
