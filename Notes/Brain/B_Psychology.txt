Controvertaial thinking

	Usually while working or doing something.
	I have and idea. for instance: Idea of do sometihing or teach something.
	And because of urge I wan't it now. And I start barging with myself about whan I should do it and about proreties.
	And I feel bad. I say NO to myself. And the longer discussion goes. The worser I feel.

	Examples:
	-Efective time usage.
	-Cleaning work space
	-Cleaining PC.
	-Work preformance tools.
	-Leraning new skill.
	-Reading articles.
	-House repar.
	-Relation ship.
	-Delivery.
	-Food.
	-Shoping.
	-Sport.
	-Self-discipline


And the issue is not only I am losing the time. But also feeling more stressed. 
The more stressed the less productive I am the more ideas I have.

Fix Formule:
1. F*ck it.
2. Get one small shit done.
