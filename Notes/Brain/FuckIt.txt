For everything else is
	"F*CK IT"

Just take a breaf moment 
to observe it's fading away

Note
The answer was always in front of me. 
I was reading a book about "Art of not giving a fuck" .
And I decided to start doing so many new things and fix so many past mistakes.
And learn so many new efective skills, and creted so many new goals.
Started rutines and trainings and project's.

I've missed one tiny ditaile.......
