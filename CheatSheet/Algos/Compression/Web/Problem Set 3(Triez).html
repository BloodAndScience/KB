	<h2>Part 2: Tries</h2>
	<p style="text-align: left">Several algorithms, including the compression
	algorithms and string matching algorithms, make use of maps where
	the keys are strings (or sequences) of values of a certain type. A <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">trie</a></b>
	<b>&nbsp;</b>(pronounced "try")&nbsp; or <b>prefix tree </b>is an efficient data
	structure for implementing the map ADT for this kind of map. The set of
	possible elements in the key strings is referred to as the <i>alphabet </i>of
	the trie.</p>
	<p style="text-align: left">A trie is a tree structure whose edges are
	labeled with the elements of the alphabet. Each node can have up to N
	children, where N is the size of the alphabet. Nodes correspond to strings
	of elements of the alphabet. More precisely, each node corresponds to the
	sequence of elements traversed on the path from the root to that node. The
	map binds a string <i>s</i> to a value <i>v </i>by storing the value<i> v
	</i>in the node of <i>s</i>. The advantage of this scheme is that if
	efficiently represents common string prefixes, and lookups or inserts are
	achieved using quick searches starting from the root. </p>
	<p style="text-align: left">Suppose we want to build a map from strings of
	ASCII characters to integer codes. In this case, edges are labeled with
	ASCII characters, and integer codes are stored in (some of) the nodes. Here
	is an example:&nbsp; </p>
	<p align="center"><img src="./Problem Set 3(Triez)_files/trie.gif" border="0" width="250" height="234"></p>
	<p align="left">The above trie describes the map <code>{"to"-&gt;7, "tea"-&gt;3,
	"ten"-&gt;12, "in"-&gt;5, "inn"-&gt;9}</code>. The values (shown in blue) are stored
	in the nodes. Note that nodes might not have values. For instance the node
	that corresponds to string <code>"te"</code> doesn't have a value. Hence,
	<code>"te"</code> is not in the map. </p>
	<p align="left">It is sometimes useful to define a cursor pointing into the
	trie, in order to cache the last search in the trie and advance the cursor
	one step at a time. </p>
	<p style="text-align: left">In this part you will implement tries that map
	strings of integers (<code>int list</code>) to values of arbitrary types (<code>'a</code>).
	Your task is to do the following:</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>
		<p style="text-align: left"><b>Interface specifications. </b>Before you

		<li>
		<p style="text-align: left"><b>Representation.</b> You must decide how

		&nbsp;</p></li>
		<li>
		<p style="text-align: left"><b>Trie operations.</b> Implement the <code>
		empty</code> value, representing an empty trie. Then implement the

		returns the binding of a string in the trie. If the string does not
		exist in the trie, then an exception <code>NotFound</code> must be
		raised. Finally, the function <code>size</code> returns the size of a
		trie; and <code>tabulate f n</code> creates a new trie with n bindings,
		where binding k is f(k), for k between 0 and n-1. </p>
		<p style="text-align: left">For example, the code <code>tabulate (fun k -&gt; ([k; k+1], k*k)) 3</code>
		would create a trie that makes <code>[0;1]</code> to 0, <code>[1;2]</code>

<h2>
Part 3: LZW Compression
</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZW">Lempel-Ziv-Welch</a> is a widely used data compression algorithm. It is a lossless compression scheme, losing no data between compression and decompression. The method was introduced in 1978 and improved in 1984, and by the late 1980s became the first widely used compression algorithm on computers. This method is always used in GIF image files, and it can optionally be used with TIFF files. Many modern compression programs, and other programs such as Adobe Acrobat, contain an implementation of LZW. In this assignment, you will be implementing LZW compression in OCaml.
</p>
<h3>
Compression
</h3>
<p>
LZW processes input by building a string translation table (also called code table, or dictionary) and converting chunks of text into fixed-length codes (often 12-bit codes are used). If the character set contains 256 characters (standard ASCII 8-bit encoding), entries 0-255 in the table are filled with the single byte codes expressed in 12 bits. The remaining entries (for 12-bit codes, these are entries 256-4095) represent sequences of bytes.
</p>
<p>
Pseudo code for the algorithm (taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZW">Wikipedia's page on LZW compression</a>):
</p>
<pre>   w = NIL;
   add all possible charcodes to the dictionary
   for (every character c in the uncompressed data) do
       if ((w + c) exists in the dictionary) then
           w = w + c;
       else
           add (w + c) to the dictionary;
           add the dictionary code for w to output;
           w = c;
       endif
   done
   add the dictionary code for w to output;
   display output;
</pre>
<p>
After initializing the table, the algorithm keeps track of two things: a string w, representing the current sequence; and a character c, the new character in the input file. If a sequence (w + c) exists in the translation table, the algorithm keeps adding bytes to the sequence by setting w to (w + c) and reading the next byte of input, c. When a sequence (w + c) does not appear in the translation table, the algorithm knows that string w is in the table, so it appends the code for w to the output file, it adds the new sequence (w + c) to the table, and it resets the current sequence (w = c).
</p>
<p>
If an input file consisted of each charcode represented exactly once, then no compression would take place (in fact, since 8-bit charcodes are replaced with 12-bit codes in the translation table, the "compressed" output would be 50% larger than the input). Importantly, LZW only compresses the input when it encounters repeated sequences.
</p>
<p>
The following is an example of the compression algorithm in action, taken from <a href="http://www.dspguide.com/ch27/5.htm">http://www.dspguide.com/ch27/5.htm</a>. Consider the ASCII string: </p><pre>the/rain/in/Spain/falls/mainly/on/the/plain/</pre>. The following table demonstrates how this string is compressed with LZW:
<p></p>

<img src="./Problem Set 3(Triez)_files/comp_ex.gif">

<p>
As a caveat, the output of this example is actually larger (408 bits) than the input (352 bits). However, the example demonstrates how new sequences are added to the translation table, and how repeated sequences allow for compression. With a proper implementation, this algorithm can compress large English texts to half their original size.
</p>
<h3>
Decompression
</h3>
<p>
The important feature of the decompression algorithm is that it does not require the translation table that was given by the compressor; instead, it rebuilds it as it processes the compressed string. Specifically, it is the requirement that every sequence be seen once and added to the table before being added to the compressed output that allows for this fact.
</p>
<p>
Pseudo code for the decompression algorithm is as follows:
</p>
<pre>   add all possible charcodes to the dictionary
   read code o
   output o
   for (each additional code n)
      w = look up dictionary entry for n
	  output w
	  add o + w[0] to dictionary
	  o = n
   done
</pre>
<p>
Each input that is read by the decompressor should be a 12-bit code corresponding to an entry in the compressor's translation dictionary. The first code in the input must represent a single character, so it can be output directly. For each additional character, the algorithm keeps track of: n, new code being read; and o, the old code that was read.
</p><p>
The resulting table from the decompression algorithm is exactly the same as that of the compression algorithm. For example, given the compressed version of the string:</p>
<pre>the/rain/in/Spain/falls/mainly/on/the/plain/</pre>
<p>the decompression algorithm looks the first code and outputs it, in this case a "t". It then looks at the next code, which is the code for "h". It looks up this entry in the table and outputs it, and then adds "th" as the 256th entry in the table, etc.
</p><p>
There is a single exception to this decompression algorithm. Suppose there is a string consisting of a string w and a character c (w + c) already defined in the table. If the input stream sees a sequence of wcwcw, the compression algorithm will produce a code before the decompressor puts it in the table.
</p><p>
Suppose the string RICKD is defined in the table. Somewhere later in the input, the sequence RICKDRICKDRICK appears. The compression will add an entry (say, entry 500) to the table mapping to the sequence RICKDR. The new string will start with R, and eventually the compressor will add the sequence RICKDRI to the table as entry 501. The problem is that the decompression algorithm as listed will read code 500 and attempt to look it up in the table before adding it.
</p><p>
Fortunately, this is the only case in which a problem occurs. To get around it, we can add a special case to the pseudo code: if a code is not definied, we know the translation is the string translation of the old code plus the first character of that string. The new pseudo code becomes:
</p><pre>   add all possible charcodes to the dictionary
   read code o
   output o
   c = o
   for (each additional code n)
      if n is not in the translation table
	     w = look up entry for o
		 w = w + c
      else
	     w = look up entry for n
	  endif
	  output w
	  c = w[0]
	  add o + c to the translation table
	  o = n
   done
</pre><p>
One final comment: while this is a relatively simple algorithm to implement, performance will suffer immensely if you are not careful when implementing the translation table. It is necessary to think about how to properly save space and runtime when writing this code.

	table, we should only write 8 bit codes to the out file; once we add another
	element to the dictionary, however, we should start using 9 bit codes for

</ol>
<p style="text-align: left"><b>To do:</b> turn in the solution in the file
