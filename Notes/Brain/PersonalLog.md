Work goes good



26.09 
Spend couple of days in coma like state sleeping 
And doing unknown things for quite some time.

I have those periods time to time. Of infinite procrastination.
But today I do official promisse of quite the TV & Video games.

I was thinking what to do it is quite simple. 
I will listen the flow book + do the meditation.
It's quite good question why did I break?


13.09
I am to mucb away rom my
Scren was to far away but now it's bettter
But now I need to turn my head to much 
And it's feals a bit uncomfortable.
Okay so tomorrow I hope to have a bit more 
of a time in order to fix all of it.

12.09
I need to get done with Artur finally.
And I did. Done with it.


06.09
I am shopoholic. I have this ubeatable desire to visit those shoping magazines
And just check the prices. Or just find the name. 



05.09 
I have this 1 million dolar deal with corry.
And I was walking around and thinking Defenetly some anexiety or something.
And I was thinking i can collect those hours working.
Let's say the deal is next:
3 hours of work equals 1 hour for personal project or 30 minutes of gaming.
I work ed for 6 hours So I can spend 2 hours on personal project.

As well good idea if my stress level is high through HRV I can just turn on meditation and play for 30 minutes while I am listening to the 
Headspace meditation and play without sound.





28.08

 I just red the previous note.
And it makes hell tone of sense
Reject finall esult. I remmeber the same issue I got with Bussiness plan.
Full picture and finall result is the issue. 
The more I try to think through the more issue my brain founds. The more thinking through required the more panic there are. 
The more panic is out there the harder it's to work.  

And it's feedback loop for hell.
As well I try to meditate. But then rememeber about something important to do start to deciding
What and when and how to do. In what order what is more important. Walking around thinking,thinking,Thinking,

Solution.... 
Reject it all.
F*ck it. Just f*ck it.
Corry f*ck it. 
Apple F*ck it. 
Monck mode Fuck it.
Meditation resut f*ck it.

I remember it was in the book Art of not giving a f*ck. 
Just fuck it. He was talling a story about trying to become great hitar player.
And that he was giving to much fucks about unimportant staff.

Soooooooooooooooooooooooo JUST FUCK IT.

I wan't that on my table.


F*ck the reparing jobs.
F*ck the HR monitor.
F*ck monck mode. 
F*ck the best solution.
F*ck perfect result.
F*ck thinking about future.
F*ck IT.

I start to think about some issue.  And I start to become super sleepy. NOt really but feeling like am super sleepy.
Let's fix that for the start. 

The issue is me planning.Walking daydreaming. Thinking through enexisting problems bing somwhere there in the future.
Solving unexisting problems. Consuming information. Finding more and more problems to solve in the future. To the point.
Where I feel so frustrated that I can go no longer.So what I am doing right now?

I just serp a coffe and find a problem it's to cold. And because being so fristrated I decided Ohhh it's good idea to go and make it hotter

Deciding what to do?
Let's walk through...
I have a goal earn sh*t tone of money.
and I have multiple opportunities. 

1. Voodoo games competition
2. Monck mode research and project.
3. HR monitor. 
4. Corry and shit tone of moeny.
5. Opportunitie from that girl Yuliia.

Should I medidate beofore the Job.
OHHHHHHHHHHHH! NO! Wait!
It's 3AM and I waked up in 5 pm I done nothing in last 10 hours. 
I should not mediate and focus on something else.
Wired right. When I was walking and thinking I don't give a fuck.
When I was huging my dog I give no f*ck .
Spend 2 hours chating with Zheka no f*ck.
3 hours moving back and forward. No f*ck.
But now when I think about sitting and meditating.
I found so many problems. 
When  i need to make app for corry I found so many problems that I need stand up.
Run around the place and think about. What the issue? Why I can spend hours and hours. 
Playing or mediting or watching videos. But I can't just sit and do the job. BTW I need to get 
Back to the video solution . It was working and really good. 
So let's good


What I 


	 26.08

I finally get it.
I understant the core issue.
I remember when there was identicall situation wiht Green Panda Games. 
I was not able to sit to the work. 
Because Iwas trying to think through finall solution.
And the harder Itry the more issues my brain found. 
The more harder task become. The issue is result and it's complexiety.
Only when I reject full picture the finall result and focus on one small task I achive something.

I have lite tones of ideas how to motivate myself:
-	meditation
- Rewards
- HR Tracking
- Shooting Video
- Pushing harder
- Planning

But it looks like I need remove last.
Less planning the better work flow.
I mean the less feadback planning the more productive I am .
About shooting video should. I try?
From stand point for Helsinky experement it make sense.
But from the standpoint of overwhelming dosen't.
	 
	 
Okay before start I would like to add text to speach tool in order to write down my comment's while coding.
Or maybe I shuold just talk. Like If I am actually teaching somebody
	 

	 Text to speech alowes me to work without speaking what is sort of cool.
	 It's separated program voice quality is pooor.
	 Okay let's poot it like that people are praying and they do talking to the good.
	 Let's try our own praying talking to the audience.


	 25.08 

	Goals

I just started to asking myself?
What is more important now. 10,000$ or Iron self-discipline?
I mean it is easear to achive 10,000$ with Iron self-discipline. 
But it's easear to train self-discipline if you have those 10,000$
And you have nothing to worry about. Nothing to worry about makes you.
Much more disciplined it self. Okay so my current situation is next.
My house needs reparing YES. 


Answer is very much clear. And obvious. 
I mean envirment issues are killing my selfdiscipline.
And I am in really despred for money. 

I mean am going crazy about this a litttle of raparing to do.
I mean the biggest issue is how little to do is there. 
And it's DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONEEEEE Just a little. 
And it's DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just need to done it. 


Okay decision is made money come first .
I mean i am desprite for money to done repair.
It's so little to do that I 
Can't wait. 
It's just simplie killing me. 
And there is just couple of things to get back.
And it's  alllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONEEEEEEEEE!
And I can focus on the work and there is nothing to worry about. 
But now reparing is my biggest issue. 
And I can't resolve it I simple don't have time.



I mean it is sort of straight forward simple
But I am really happy when I am doing games. 
And I am super unhappy when I do planning and decissions. 
i don't have reall	



Okay today I faced a really specifice problem I was blind about.
Anexiety about being not productive enough. 
Anexiety about being not disciplined enough.

An example I try to decide what is better to meditate during walk with a dogs or to listen some HQaudiobook.
And guesss waht I panic about it . Really hard core anexity is breatking through and I become extremly sleepy and lazy.
I am so stressed out I have unbeatable desire to jast lay down for a couple of seconds and watch some TV show.
For matter of fact it dosen't metter what TV show just lay down and watch. 

And yes thinking about productivity makes me super unproductive. Tones of artiles to read that I didn't read yet. That stress me out.
Tones of book to read that streses me out. Tones of skills to develop that stress me out. Tones of staff undone that stress me out. 
I am even stress what skill or book or article to read next. Maybe it's good to learn new programming skill or self-discipline. 
LIke my work has direct corelation with discipline right?  Or wait wait wait I need Learning skill If I wan't to learn something.
Or maybe even memorizing skill. Or bodybuilding like exerciceses help with study I read article about it. And watched like 200 videos
on YouTube about it. 

Even if I will decide something and picked it up. It's really almost impossible to finish. I am always overwhelmed with books courses
songs. Audiobooks, Articles and e.t.c. 
I need to hold all of them. And read none of them because Ain't not time for that. I am to stresssed about picking up wrong
Somebody please turn on some show i need to relax.

Okay I feel that I spoked.

Now to my question audiobook or meditation.


Audiobook:
	Pros 
1. New info 
2. Passive learning.
2. There is tones of books I wan't to finish.

	Cons
1. Distruction (It's hard to listen if you distruct)
2. A bit stress. 
3. Anexiety - tipically audiobooks make me thing. sometimes it lead to stress
4. Time consuming tipically I need to write something down. And work through it.
And I remember when I was going for the run then coming back home and spending hours processing something. 
I just listen. I mean it's should be much better to spend big chuck of time specifically for audio books.


Another stressfull thing. 
Do or not to do it.?

Okay for instance I start to clearning up and sorting songs.
Should I done it.  
Or should I stop and start doing more important staff?
I mean there should not be a question mark.

Maybe one day i will get in order but now.
Okay so my plan now is next:

Okay I just simplie chack the mails


Another thing I can't get to work.


I mean i am so stressed and so tight. 
That I can't literally can't start working.
And the more I think the more stressed I am 
Okay so now I have a clear goal wite first 10 lines of gode.






I Do LITERaly everything excpe the work .

I am so tired from anexity. 
I am so tired from stess. 


I am trying to start working but I am ot able.

I need to break that loop. 
But how? What shell I do and how.

And reason of my anexiety is undone job. 
What shell I do.
