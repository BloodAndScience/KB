# Study Plan

## Why?

I should start now from the materials.
Not from the courses and get it from the start to end.
But this time I will start with endgoal.
Then make series of questions.
Then make NUNIT Tests out of those quesions.
And then start feeling it with existing code and materials.

Goal>Question>UnitTest>Study

### Goal

- Detect Hand(Analog) Watch from image.
- Box out that watch.
- Classify That watch.

So as Mattiew guy sad there is 3 types of CV:

1. Classification.
2. BoxAround.
3. Label.

And we probably start with First one.

### Questions

0. How the hell computer vision Works?
1. ML.Net what it is and how to eat it.
   1. I need briew terminology CNN CV e.t.c?
2. TenserFlow what it is? Is it better then ML.NET
    - TenserFlow-Sharp?
3. OpenCV terminology just basic one.
    - And what parts of it will I need?
    - What is good and what is bad in Unity OpenCV.

4. How to find the f*cking watch.
    - Combine CV and ML

## Tasks

- [ ] Is watch on Image?
- [ ] ML.NET model for that
- [ ] OpenCV Unity for that
- [ ] Box around the Watch.
- [ ] Classify the Watch.
