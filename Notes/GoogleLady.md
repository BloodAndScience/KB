* Cristie lived in the US for over a year and worked at Google as a recruiter for 11 months.
* She managed to get [L-2 visa](https://www.immihelp.com/l2-visa/) (L-1 dependant).
* Her husband had [L-1](https://www.uscis.gov/forms/explore-my-options/l-visas-l-1a-and-l-1b-for-temporary-workers) -
  a temporary intracompany transfer visa.
* Employers are generally reluctant to sponsor the Green Card for L-2 visa holders because they don't want employers
  start looking for a better offer when they're free to work at other companies.
* Engineers transferred from the Eastern Europe on O-2 visa are getting payed well below the median salary in the area.
* Cristie bitches about the healthcare system in the US. She tells a story about her colleague at Google who needed an
  emergency surgery and ended up with a medical bill of $16k, the other case she mentions is about a burn victim who
  ended up with a medical debt of $500k;
* Cristie bitches about the education system in the US and how expensive it is. Some of her colleagues at Google took
  out student loans and ended up in debt(?!).
* Kristine continues bitching about how no all of the people with student debt could get a median salary in San
  Francisco(?!).
* She talk about San Fran and how dangerous it is to live there, she talks about car break-ins, the homelessness
  problem, feces on the streets etc.
* Cristie likes [Kyiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv) better because she doesn't like working hard.
* Cristie didn't like her shitty temporary emigration status.
* Cristie talk about the process of getting a [EAD Card](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/nonimmigrant/employment/ead/) -
  after application it takes 4 months to get.
* She started looking for a job before getting the EAD Card and lying that she already had it. That's the way she
  started practicing interviewing process.
* Cristie bitches that finding a job in the USA is tough even for engineers. She mentions that for some of her
  acquaintances from Ukraine having decent work experience (in Ukraine), Green Card and Work Permit it would take 4-6
  months to find a job in an american company.
* Cristie says that for a recruiter finding first job in the US is especially hard cause you have to speak the language
  freely(?!). She begged her friends from FAANG to give her recommendations but it didn't help much (at all).
* Cristie says that out of every 100 CVs she would send out only 9-10 would get a response. Afterwards there is
  generally a 30 minutes phone interview, an onsite with the lead recruiter and a series of onsites with the team (4 to
  5, 30 to 45 min interviews).
* After a month of looking a job Cristie was contracted by staffing agency and offered a position of Design Recruiter in
  a company that created "The most popular search engine in the world". They were looking for a UX Recruiter and my
  Linkedin had quite a few of "design" keywords in it.
* With Google she had 6 interviews in total: one over the phone with recruiter, three remote over Google Meet, and two
  onsites. She praises the interviewing process at Google.
* She says for a recruitment position work experience or ability to use specific software didn't really matter. Problem
  solving and leadership skills were much more important.
* Simultaneity with Google she had final interviews with a few small startup companies - in the end she got 3 offers and
  chose Google over a startup offering a better salary.
* Cristie has no idea about how competitive the position she's got was. She only know that in a yer Google received 3
  million CVs.
* Experience in UX recruiting helped her to get through the interviews, she mentions that she accepted a more junior
  position in Google than the one she had un Ukraine.
* Christie talks about recruitment process in Google. Whether you get a recommendation by an insider or send Google your
  CV a first your application gets to Active Channels team. Christie says grammatical errors won't get your application
  automatically rejected, cause that way no nigger would ever be able to work at Google and that would be racist.
* Active Channels are first to filter out some SVs and pass them to a Sourcing Recruiter. Cristie held a position of UX
  Sourcing Recruiter.
* Cristie says that despite the large amount of CVs Google receives most of her time was spent of searching for UX
  Designer on Linkedin Premium.
* 60 to 70 percent of employees are getting hired by the recruiters searching for suitable candidates on Linkedin.
* Portfolio always gets reviewed before the initial contact with the candidate.
* Cristie believes that if you don't have a FAANG experience or graduated a top university you would need to prepare up
  to 1.5 years (for engineers) to successfully pass a Google interview.
