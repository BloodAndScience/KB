3 DoF vs 6 DoF

**3 DoF** headsets restrict you to one group of axes, whether rotational or translational. These work best when you want to watch a film or experience 360 video. 

**6 DoF** headsets allow for tracking of the position and orientation within a headset. You can track both head and body movement in a 3D environment.
